# Restaurant-Recommendation-in-Python
Nowadays there are so many restaurants in one city. If a person searches on Google, it gives a bunch of restaurant names available in that particular city.
There should be a platform where people can sort the restaurants on particular locations, dishes, and popularity.
Todayâ€™s generation prefers cafes over restaurants. Restaurant Recommender is a user-friendly interface that will solve such problems of a user in offline mode.
